one website I really like is jennys RC. Its a simple website for buying parts for rc cars, I like the drop down menues and I like the simple home page
  that isnt super cluttered but still has suggested catagories.
  https://jennysrc.com
Another one is the traxxas website its a very organized website that makes it easy to find the exact parts you need.
  They let you pick what rc car you have and sort by part catagory making it easy and quick to find the parts you need.

Chat GPT is another website I like. I like how easy it is to find previous conversations and how easy and quick it is to switch between conversations.
  https://chat.openai.com
one website Im not a big fan of is the amazon website. they make it pretty easy to find what you want but the home page is super clutered and there are menus
  inside menus and some of them you have to click while others you hover over.
  https://www.amazon.com
another one i dont like is most streaming servises like youtube, nextflix, and hulu. they flood you with to many recomendations and I think as a result
  are harder to navigate than they need to be.
