https://jennysrc.com/ Its a simple website for buying parts for rc cars, I like the drop down menues and I like the simple home page that isnt super cluttered but still has         suggested categories.

https://traxxas.com/ very organized website that makes it easy to find the exact parts you need. They let you pick what rc car you have and sort by part catagory making it           easy and quick to find the parts you need. however this website, I think, looks very cluttered

https://chat.openai.com I like how easy it is to find previous conversations and how easy and quick it is to switch between conversations

https://www.amazon.com/ not a big fan of is the amazon website. they make it pretty easy to find what you want but the home page is super clutered and there are menus inside menus and some of them you have to click while others you hover over

lastly i dont like most streaming servises like youtube, nextflix, and hulu. they flood you with to many recomendations and I think as a result are harder to navigate than they need to be.
